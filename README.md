## Devlog #8 — 06/11/2023: 
Fixed bugs, blocked wild battles due to un-fixed bug, added new background processes.
## Devlog #9 - 07/14/2023:
It's been a while since the last devlog, the wild-battle bug has been fixed thanks to [@Andreas010](https://github.com/Andreas010) , a custom controller system has been implemented but not given a UI yet, so the current controls are : 
```
    UP : W
    DOWN : S
    LEFT : A 
    RIGHT : D
    ACTION : J
    BACJ : K
    START : Enter / Return
```
